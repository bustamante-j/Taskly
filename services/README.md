# Services

This directory contains all external service integrations and backend configurations. Each service is organized in its own folder with utilities, configurations, and helper functions.

## 📋 Sample Folder Structure

```
services/
├── firebase/
│   ├── config.ts          # Firebase initialization and configuration
│   └── utils.ts           # Firebase helper functions (CRUD operations)
└── README.md              # This file
```

## 📋 Service Organization Guidelines

When adding new external services, follow this structure:

1. **Create a service folder** (e.g., `service_name/`)
2. **Configuration file** (`config.ts`): Initialize and export service instances
3. **Utilities file** (`utils.ts`): Provide reusable wrapper functions around the service API
4. **Documentation**: Include inline comments and update this README

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Centralize configurations**: Keep all service configurations in `config.ts`
- **Wrap service calls**: Use utility functions to abstract service implementations
- **Type safety**: Use TypeScript interfaces for all service operations
- **Environment variables**: Never hardcode credentials; use environment variables
- **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling in utility functions
- **Reusability**: Design utilities to be used across multiple features
- **Scalability**: Structure follows a pattern that scales well as features grow
